Congratulations again to all newly admitted PhD Students! 
his website provides information about Yale's Computer Science Department Visit Day planned for March 7th, 2025.
Additionally, it offers valuable resources for new students, including information about the CS Department and Yale and examples of research projects by current students.

Below is the schedule; all the times are in the Eastern Time Zone (ET).
Note the locations across events ([WTS](https://goo.gl/maps/pRswmHtr5HYjTyRm8) is not the same building as [AKW](https://goo.gl/maps/wuCJ7dyBKUDgN9ix9)).

# CS @ YALE

The [Department of Computer Science at Yale](https://cpsc.yale.edu/) is a stimulating environment in which new ideas, experimental designs, and robust systems are plentiful.
In trying to shape the very nature of computer science, it is not enough to ask why things are, nor to ask how things will beâ€”but rather, to ask how things should be now and in the future.
How should computers be used in our society, and why?
How should we design software, algorithms, new theories of computation?
How should computer science be taught?
What should the legacy of our efforts be?

Below are links to relevant sites about the Department and related organizations.

- **Arthur K Watson Hall.**
  Arthur Kittredge "Dick" Watson (BA 1942) was an American businessman and diplomat.
  He served as president of IBM World Trade Corporation and United States Ambassador to France.
  The *Computer Science Building* is named in his honor.
  His father Thomas J. Watson, is the founder of IBM.

  The faculty, researchers, and students in the Department of Computer Science have access to a wide variety of ever-changing state-of-the-art computing resources at Yale, including cloud compute resources via the Yale Center for Research Computing.
  In addition, individual research groups have specialized equipment for robotics, computer vision, computer music, parallel computing, networking, and other research efforts.
