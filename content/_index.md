title = "Yale CS Visit Day '25"
+++

Congratulations again to all newly admitted PhD Students! 
his website provides information about Yale's Computer Science Department Visit Day planned for March 7th, 2025.
Additionally, it offers valuable resources for new students, including information about the CS Department and Yale and examples of research projects by current students.

Below is the schedule; all the times are in the Eastern Time Zone (ET).
Note the locations across events ([WTS](https://goo.gl/maps/pRswmHtr5HYjTyRm8) is not the same building as [AKW](https://goo.gl/maps/wuCJ7dyBKUDgN9ix9)).

# CS @ YALE

The [Department of Computer Science at Yale](https://cpsc.yale.edu/) is a stimulating environment in which new ideas, experimental designs, and robust systems are plentiful.
In trying to shape the very nature of computer science, it is not enough to ask why things are, nor to ask how things will beâ€”but rather, to ask how things should be now and in the future.
How should computers be used in our society, and why?
How should we design software, algorithms, new theories of computation?
How should computer science be taught?
What should the legacy of our efforts be?

Below are links to relevant sites about the Department and related organizations.

- **Center for Engineering Innovation and Design (CEID).**
  Since opening in 2012, the Center for *[Engineering Innovation and Design (CEID)](http://ceid.yale.edu/)* has served as a hub for collaborative design and interdisciplinary activity at Yale University.
  Its goal is to enable the design, development, and actualization of ideas, from the whiteboard to the real world.
  Students, staff, and faculty from across Yale have access to CEID resources, participate in courses and events, and collaborate with CEID staff on a wide range of projects.
