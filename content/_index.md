Congratulations again to all newly admitted PhD Students! 
his website provides information about Yale's Computer Science Department Visit Day planned for March 7th, 2025.
Additionally, it offers valuable resources for new students, including information about the CS Department and Yale and examples of research projects by current students.

Below is the schedule; all the times are in the Eastern Time Zone (ET).
Note the locations across events ([WTS](https://goo.gl/maps/pRswmHtr5HYjTyRm8) is not the same building as [AKW](https://goo.gl/maps/wuCJ7dyBKUDgN9ix9)).

# CS @ YALE

The [Department of Computer Science at Yale](https://cpsc.yale.edu/) is a stimulating environment in which new ideas, experimental designs, and robust systems are plentiful.
In trying to shape the very nature of computer science, it is not enough to ask why things are, nor to ask how things will be—but rather, to ask how things should be now and in the future.
How should computers be used in our society, and why?
How should we design software, algorithms, new theories of computation?
How should computer science be taught?
What should the legacy of our efforts be?

Below are links to relevant sites about the Department and related organizations.

Watson Hall**</center> <br/> Arthur Kittredge "Dick" Watson (BA 1942) was an American businessman and diplomat. He served as president of IBM World Trade Corporation and United States Ambassador to France. The *Computer Science Building* is named in his honor. His father Thomas J. Watson, is the founder of IBM. The faculty, researchers, and students in the Department of Computer Science have access to a wide variety of ever-changing state-of-the-art computing resources at Yale, including cloud compute resources via the *[Yale Center for Research Computing](https://research.computing.yale.edu/)*. In addition, individual research groups have specialized equipment for robotics, computer vision, computer music, parallel computing, networking, and other research efforts. |

Its goal is to enable the design, development, and actualization of ideas, from the whiteboard to the real world. Students, staff, and faculty from across Yale have access to CEID resources, participate in courses and events, and collaborate with CEID staff on a wide range of projects. |

A unit of Yale College Arts, CCAM guides students, faculty, and collaborators in expanding and exploring all manner of projects. |

Not surprisingly, YINS is home to researchers hailing from different disciplines and schools across Yale University. Affiliated faculty and other researchers share many common technical and scientific challenges. These include: developing statistical and computational tools for processing big data; developing new models for complex networks; understanding how networks dynamically change in time; developing techniques for learning and inference in networks; developing methodologies for the design of networks; understanding diffusion processes (of germs, information, behaviors, etc.,) in networks; and understanding emergent behavior (i.e., how local interactions can lead to global phenomena). |

Examples of questions include understanding how humans behave in the face of algorithms and designing computational methods that empower society. |

Launched in 2017, Tsai CITY serves students from across Yale’s campus through programs, funding, and mentoring. We’re building a new kind of innovation center, one rooted in inclusivity: here, students from all backgrounds tackle issues like climate change and civic engagement, develop creative projects from documentary films to digital platforms, and launch high-growth ventures and movements. |
