# CS @ YALE

The [Department of Computer Science at Yale](https://cpsc.yale.edu/) is a stimulating environment in which new ideas, experimental designs, and robust systems are plentiful.
In trying to shape the very nature of computer science, it is not enough to ask why things are, nor to ask how things will be—but rather, to ask how things should be now and in the future.
How should computers be used in our society, and why?
How should we design software, algorithms, new theories of computation?
How should computer science be taught?
What should the legacy of our efforts be?

Below are links to relevant sites about the Department and related organizations.

He served as president of IBM World Trade Corporation and United States Ambassador to France. The Computer Science Building is named in his honor. His father Thomas J. Watson, is the founder of IBM. The faculty, researchers, and students in the Department of Computer Science have access to a wide variety of ever-changing state-of-the-art computing resources at Yale, including cloud compute resources via the *[Yale Center for Research Computing](https://research.computing.yale.edu/)*. In addition, individual research groups have specialized equipment for robotics, computer vision, computer music, parallel computing, networking, and other research efforts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Affiliated faculty and other researchers share many common technical and scientific challenges. These include: developing statistical and computational tools for processing big data; developing new models for complex networks; understanding how networks dynamically change in time; developing techniques for learning and inference in networks; developing methodologies for the design of networks; understanding diffusion processes (of germs, information, behaviors, etc.,) in networks; and understanding emergent behavior (i.e., how local interactions can lead to global phenomena). |

Launched in 2017, Tsai CITY serves students from across Yale’s campus through programs, funding, and mentoring. We’re building a new kind of innovation center, one rooted in inclusivity: here, students from all backgrounds tackle issues like climate change and civic engagement, develop creative projects from documentary films to digital platforms, and launch high-growth ventures and movements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

<!-- # Research Showcase

The Ph.D. program in Computer Science stresses unique and innovative research. Toward that end, the course requirements are modest, and students normally begin to focus on research by the fall term of their second year of graduate study. Details about the program of study can be found in the [Computer Science Graduate Handbook](https://cpsc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/CS_Graduate_Handbook-2022-23.pdf).
Below are a few examples of recent research projects by PhD students and researchers in the Yale Computer Science Department.
